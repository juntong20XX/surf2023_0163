# XJTLU SURF Project 2023: Group 0163

## About This Project

This project is a part of XJTLU Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Project.

In this Project, associate professor [Yin Cao](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/study/departments/academic-departments/intelligent-science/department-staff/academic-staff/staff/yin-cao) leads 6 undergraduate students to explore and learn neural networks for music and dialogue separation. As part of the practice, we managed to simplify [dumucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs). We created an academic poster at the end of the project to showcase our results.

In this project, I read the paper with my classmates and reported it to the teacher at the weekly meeting. Additionally, actively involved in selecting and leasing high-performance servers and configuring their environment to run and develop projects remotely and worked independently on the `dumucs-simplify` project.

## About SURF Project

The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) at Xi'an  Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) is an annual program designed to  enhance the research capabilities of undergraduate students by offering  them the opportunity to engage in research projects across various  disciplines. The program aims to apply theoretical knowledge to  real-world problems, encouraging a spirit of exploration and innovation  among students. With the support of academic guidance and funding,  students participate in projects that range from artificial intelligence and biomedicine to language and culture, business development, and  architectural design. The culmination of the SURF program is marked by  the SURF Poster Day, where students showcase their projects, which are  then evaluated by both teachers and students.

In 2023, the SURF initiative witnessed significant achievements, with over 1,000 students participating in 216 projects, marking a record in the number of projects, participants, and awards. This level of engagement underscores the program's success in fostering research skills and collaboration among undergraduates at XJTLU. Not only does the SURF program offer students a platform to apply classroom knowledge to tackle societal, industrial, and global challenges, but it also facilitates the development of their research skills and the acquisition of new knowledge, embodying the essence of research-led learning.
